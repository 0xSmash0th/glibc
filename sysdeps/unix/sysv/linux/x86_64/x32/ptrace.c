/* Since x32 ptrace stores 32-bit base address of segment register %fs
   and %gs as unsigned 64-bit value via ARCH_GET_FS and ARCH_GET_GS with
   PTRACE_ARCH_PRCTL, we use a local unsigned 64-bit variable to hold
   the base address and copy it to ADDR after ptrace return.

   We don't use

   long int ptrace (enum __ptrace_request __request, ...);

   since x32 passes all 4 parameters in registers, which is the same
   as the non-stdarg call.  The generated code is much simpler.
